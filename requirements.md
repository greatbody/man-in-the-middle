# Project Requirements

## Overview
This project will expose two ports: one for intercepting HTTP(S) requests and forwarding them to target destinations, and another for accessing a web interface to view logged requests and responses. The system will support header manipulation. SQLite will be used as the storage backend for simplicity and portability.

## Functional Requirements

- Listen on a configurable port for incoming HTTP(S) requests.
- Forward intercepted requests to specified target domain/IP, with configurable port and protocol.
- Log and store HTTP messages according to standard format:
  - Start line (request line or status line)
  - Headers (standard HTTP headers following RFC specifications)
  - Empty line
  - Optional message body
  - Timing information and metadata
- Capture and store all standard HTTP headers as defined in MDN documentation
- Allow configuration to remove or modify headers added by reverse proxies (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`).
- Support both HTTP and HTTPS for incoming and outgoing connections with SSL/TLS decryption capabilities.
- Provide an intuitive web interface with:
  - Real-time HTTP message logging display using SQLite change notifications
  - Advanced search functionality with filters (method, status, domain, etc.) using SQLite FTS5
  - Syntax-highlighted HTTP message content following standard format
  - Collapsible JSON/XML formatting for message bodies
  - Request/response timeline visualization
  - Export capabilities for logged data (CSV, JSON formats) preserving HTTP message structure

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Secure handling of sensitive data in HTTP messages and logs with SQLite encryption extension.
- Configurable logging level and retention policy with automatic database cleanup.
- High performance and low latency for request forwarding.
- Easy deployment and configuration (e.g., via environment variables or config files).
- Clear separation between proxy and management interfaces.
- Mobile-friendly web interface design.
- Fast search and filtering performance using SQLite indexes and optimized queries.
- Automatic database maintenance (vacuum, optimize) for sustained performance.

## Future Considerations

- Rate limiting and abuse prevention using SQLite-based counters.
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems.
- Support for additional protocols if needed.
- HTTP message modification capabilities following standard format.
- Support for custom SSL certificates management.
- Database backup and restore capabilities.
